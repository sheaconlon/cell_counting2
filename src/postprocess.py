    """Count the number of regions in an image. Uses a classifier that can, for
        any given pixel of the image, give the probabilities of that pixel being
        inside a region, on the edge of a region, and outside all regions.

    Treats the edges of the image accoring to the "valid" strategy.

    Args:
        image (np.ndarray): The image. Must have shape (height, width,
            channels).
        patch_size (int): The side length of the patches to feed to
            patch_classifier, in pixels. Must be odd and at least 3.
        patch_classifier (func): The patch scorer. Takes as argument a
            np.ndarray of shape (num_patches, patch_size, patch_size,
            channels) giving a sequence of patches of the image. Returns a
            np.ndarray of shape (num_patches, 3), where the i-th row pertains to
            the pixel at the center of the i-th patch and gives the
            probabilities of that pixel being inside a region, on the edge of a
            region, and outside all regions, respectively.
        batch_size (int): The ideal number of patches to submit to
            patch_scorer in each call.
        min_dist (int): The minimum distance between the centers of two regions,
            in pixels.
        min_diam (float): The minimum diameter of a region, in pixels.
        sampling_interval (int): In every square of the image with side length
            sampling_interval pixels, a single pixel will be chosen for
            classification. The default value is 1, which causes every pixel to
            be classified.
        debug (bool): Whether to plot each intermediate step for debugging
            purposes. False by default.

    Returns:
        (int) The number of regions in the image.
